US Keyboard layout with special chars like accents without dead keys.

It was made to type French with QWERTY, but other languages can also use it.

Special characters are typed using AltGr key (Ctrl+Alt)

Feel free to use it as is, or modify it using : [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134)

To install it as is on Windows, you just need to launch the setup.exe from the [latest release](https://github.com/paul2t/keyboard_layout_us_fr/releases/latest)
